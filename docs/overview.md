# Overview

## What is Armory?

Armory is a UI testing framework for iOS built in Swift. 

Armory allows you to quickly get started with UI testing in your new or existing app by allowing you to test your view controllers in isolation. 

## Benefits of Armory

Armory offers many benefits over Apple's built-in UI testing framework, while providing you with the same intuitive functionality you would expect.

Need to simulate a user tapping a button? Just call `tap(myButton)` 

Need to simulate a user typing into a text field? Just call `type(myTextField, "some text")`

We've created Armory from the ground up with a developer-first mentality to make it as easy as possible to include UI testing in your app.

In addition to being easy to use, Armory is also fast. By spinning up a new window for each test, Armory makes it possible to test each of your view controllers in isolation without having to restart your app. No more starting with `XCUIApplication` and having to navigate to the screen you want before each test.
